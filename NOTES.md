# Notes

- End points
  - POST /request
  - POST /callback/{id}
  - PUT /callback{id}
  - GET /status/{id}

- To stay on spec going to use Azure Functions and CosmosDB
- First pass adding file .cs for each function separating HTTP verbs
- Routes/verbs are set, didn't get too much done during the day
